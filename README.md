# Diabetes-Prediction
In this diabetes prediction project, we import dependencies, analyze the PIMA dataset, standardize data, split for training, and evaluate the model's accuracy, presenting a predictive system.
# Importing the Dependencies:

Import necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
# Data Collection and Analysis:

Obtain the dataset for diabetes prediction.
Analyze the dataset's structure, features, and target variable.
Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
# PIMA Diabetes Dataset:

Introduce the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.
Highlight the dataset's significance in diabetes prediction.
# 0 --> Non-Diabetic, 1 --> Diabetic:

Explain the binary classification nature of the problem.
Define the target variable categories (0 for Non-Diabetic, 1 for Diabetic).
# Data Standardization:

Standardize or normalize the feature variables for better model performance.
# Train Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Typically, use 70-80% of the data for training and the rest for testing.
# Training the Model:

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Train the model using the training dataset.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
Utilize metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Accuracy Score:

Calculate and discuss the accuracy score of the model.
Highlight the importance of understanding both false positives and false negatives in a medical context.
# Making a Predictive System:

Develop a predictive system using the trained model.
Showcase how users can input their data for diabetes prediction.
# GitHub Repository Structure:

Organize code, data, and documentation in a clear directory structure.
Include a README.md file with project overview, dataset description, and instructions.
# Documentation:

Provide comments in the code for better understanding.
Document the steps and decisions made throughout the project.
# Future Improvements:

Suggest possible enhancements or future directions for the project.
Encourage contributions from the community.
